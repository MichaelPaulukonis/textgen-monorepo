# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Common Corpus project. ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the development of the project, including the context, decision, and consequences.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are short text documents that capture an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. They help teams understand why certain decisions were made and provide historical context for future development.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: Title

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
```

## Current ADRs

### Core Architecture Decisions

- [ADR-0001: Use File-Based Text Storage](./ADR-0001-file-based-storage.md) - **Accepted**
- [ADR-0002: Lazy Loading Strategy](./ADR-0002-lazy-loading.md) - **Accepted**
- [ADR-0003: Synchronous API Design](./ADR-0003-synchronous-api.md) - **Deprecated**
- [ADR-0004: NLP Library Selection](./ADR-0004-nlp-library.md) - **Superseded**

### Text Processing Decisions

- [ADR-0005: Text Encoding Standardization](./ADR-0005-encoding-standardization.md) - **Accepted**
- [ADR-0006: Paragraph Reconstruction Algorithm](./ADR-0006-debreak-algorithm.md) - **Accepted**

### Future Decisions (Proposed)

- [ADR-0007: Migration to Async API](./ADR-0007-async-migration.md) - **Proposed**
- [ADR-0008: Caching Strategy](./ADR-0008-caching-strategy.md) - **Proposed**
- [ADR-0009: Security Improvements](./ADR-0009-security-improvements.md) - **Proposed**

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. **Create a new ADR file** following the naming convention `ADR-XXXX-short-title.md`
2. **Use the next sequential number** (check existing ADRs for the highest number)
3. **Follow the standard format** outlined above
4. **Start with "Proposed" status** and update as the decision evolves
5. **Link related ADRs** when decisions build upon or supersede previous ones

### ADR Lifecycle

```
Proposed → Accepted → [Deprecated | Superseded]
```

- **Proposed**: Decision is under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision has been made and is being implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended but may still be in use
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Guidelines for Writing ADRs

### Context Section
- Explain the forces at play (technical, political, social, project)
- Describe the problem that needs to be solved
- Include relevant background information
- Reference related decisions or constraints

### Decision Section
- State the decision clearly and concisely
- Explain the reasoning behind the decision
- Include alternatives that were considered
- Mention any trade-offs or compromises

### Consequences Section
- List positive consequences (benefits)
- List negative consequences (costs, risks)
- Describe impact on other parts of the system
- Note any follow-up actions required

## ADR Review Process

1. **Draft**: Create ADR with "Proposed" status
2. **Discussion**: Share with team for feedback and discussion
3. **Review**: Formal review in team meeting or pull request
4. **Decision**: Accept, reject, or request changes
5. **Implementation**: Update status to "Accepted" and implement
6. **Maintenance**: Update status if decision changes over time

## Tools and Templates

### ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Short Title]

## Status
Proposed

## Context
[Describe the context and problem statement]

## Decision
[Describe the decision and rationale]

## Consequences
### Positive
- [List benefits]

### Negative
- [List costs and risks]

### Neutral
- [List other impacts]
```

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Create new ADR
cp docs/architecture/decisions/template.md docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-XXXX-title.md

# List all ADRs
ls docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-*.md

# Find ADRs by status
grep -l "Status.*Accepted" docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-*.md
```

## Historical Context

The Common Corpus project began as a simple file-based text collection. As the project has evolved, we've documented key architectural decisions to help future contributors understand the reasoning behind current design choices and to guide future development.

Key themes in our architectural decisions:
- **Simplicity over complexity** - Prefer simple solutions that work
- **Performance considerations** - Balance functionality with performance
- **Community accessibility** - Make the library easy to use and contribute to
- **Future flexibility** - Design for evolution and extension
