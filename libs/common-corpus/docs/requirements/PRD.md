## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
Common Corpus is a Node.js library that provides developers with easy access to a curated collection of texts for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) projects. The library serves as a foundational resource for researchers, developers, and data scientists working on text analysis, machine learning, and computational linguistics projects.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
NLP/NLG developers frequently need access to diverse text corpora for training, testing, and experimentation. Currently, developers must:
- Manually collect and curate text datasets
- Handle various file formats and encodings
- Implement text preprocessing and cleaning
- Manage large text collections efficiently

### 1.3 Solution Overview
Common Corpus provides a unified API to access 100+ curated texts across multiple genres and domains, with built-in text processing capabilities and a simple filtering system.
